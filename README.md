# Titanic_ML_EDA

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as gender, age, ticket class, etc. We will use machine learning techniques to analyze the data and build a predictive model.

Steps:

1. **Understanding the Data:**
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
   - Identify missing values and decide how to handle them.
   - Visualize the data to gain insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values (impute or drop).
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).
   - Scale or normalize the features if necessary.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features if required.
   - Extract information from existing features.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explore relationships between features and survival.
   - Visualize the data using plots and graphs.

5. **Model Building:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests).
   - Train the model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

6. **Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the model parameters using techniques like cross-validation.
   - Evaluate the model on the test set to assess its performance.

7. **Prediction:**
   - Make predictions on new data.
   - Calculate the percentage of females and males who survived.

    Detailed Explanation:

  1. Understanding the Data:
   - The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc.
   - Explore the dataset using libraries like Pandas and NumPy to understand its structure and features.
   - Use functions like `info()`, `describe()`, and `head()` to get a quick overview of the data.
   - Check for missing values using functions like `isnull()` and handle them appropriately.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values:
     - For numerical features, impute missing values using the mean or median.
     - For categorical features, impute missing values with the mode or a new category.
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
   - Scale or normalize the features if necessary to ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis.

#### 3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features if required, such as family size (combining `SibSp` and `Parch`).
   - Extract information from existing features, such as titles from names.

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Explore relationships between features and survival using visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots.
   - Analyze the impact of each feature on survival rates.
   - Investigate correlations between features.

#### 5. Model Building:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests).
   - Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance using cross-validation.
   - Tune hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.

#### 6. Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search.
   - Validate the model's performance using techniques like k-fold cross-validation.

#### 7. Prediction:
   - Once the model is trained and validated, make predictions on new data.
   - Calculate the percentage of females and males who survived to determine the impact of gender on survival chances.
